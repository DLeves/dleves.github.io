# Introduction

Hello, I’m Levente Dittrich.  
I am passionate about extracting insights from data through visualization and modeling, with a focus on predictive analytics for practical applications. I am proficient in R and have advanced skills in Python. My expertise includes classical statistical and econometric modeling, as well as machine learning techniques such as tree-based models, boosting, and deep learning architectures like LSTM, applied to both regression and classification tasks.  
I also have experience with natural language processing tools, including analysing business, finance and economy related text with FinBERT.
